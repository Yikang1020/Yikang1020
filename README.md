- 👋 Hi, I’m Yikang Liu, RA at Guangdong Institute of Intelligence Science and Technology. Now, I’m a memeber of Laboratory of Cognitive Neural Representation and Regulation.

- 🧑‍💻 My main research are:

  - How do we construct internal models of abstract task?
 
  - How does our brain’s offline activity (like mental replay) help consolidate and reorganize these maps?
 
  - How do we then use these maps to make flexible decisions?

---

- 👀 I am Teaching Assistant of two course:

  - Psychological Statistics for undergraduates (2022.2 - Now);

  - Advanced Psychological Statistics for undergraduates (2022.9 - 2023.1).

- 🌱 I’m currently using neuroimaging(EEG and fMRI), machine learning and computational model to solve my research.
